3. **Choose Your VPS Plan**: Select a VPS plan based on your resource needs. For example, you can opt for a plan with **1 vCPU, 2 GB of RAM, and 60 GB of storage** if you’re deploying a moderate workload. You can always resize or upgrade your plan later if necessary.

5. **Set Up SSH Key (Optional)**: For secure, passwordless access to your VPS, you can add an SSH key by clicking “Add New SSH Key.” If you're unfamiliar with SSH keys or need guidance on setting them up, refer to **[Cloudzy’s guide on SSH key configuration](https://cloudzy.com/kb/linux/connection/)**. You can skip this step if you prefer to use traditional password authentication.
